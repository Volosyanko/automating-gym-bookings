# automating-gym-bookings
The aim of this project is to being to begin learning python by undertaking a project that will allow me to automatically make bookings at the university gym. Currently, due to covid all members must make bookings, but with only 30-40 spaces these bookings are typically filled up quickly and members can only book 3 days in advance at most. I am going to be a little bit cheeky and use python to instantly and automatically make bookings for me at certain days and times the moment these bookings are opened up to relieve me of the effort of having to do this manually myself.

I made 3 sales with this small project.
