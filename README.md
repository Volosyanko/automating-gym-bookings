The aim of this project is to being to begin learning python by undertaking a project that will allow me to automatically make bookings at the university gym. Currently, due to covid all members must make bookings, but with only 30-40 spaces these bookings are typically filled up quickly and members can only book 3 days in advance at most. I am going to be a little bit cheeky and use python to guarantee a gym slot for me on certain days and times.
